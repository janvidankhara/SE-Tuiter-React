## Problem Statement

In terms of functionality, We need a set of features to boost engagement and make the app
interesting to use in order to gain and retain users.We plan to implement a secure private chat .Tuiter's private chat
feature is a wonderful way to collaborate and debate with other Tuiter users. There is currently no method to keep track
of conversations as they occur. A private chat will be included in our implementation. On Tuiter, a user can send a direct
message to any other active user. We have used socket. io to enable simultaneous sending/receiving of message for both the users involved in the chat.

Bookmarking a tuit is also very popular and helpful these days. A user can click on the bookmark button displayed in every tuit and bookmark the tuit.Upon bookmarking, the button changes colour from black to blue. A user can then see the bookmarked tuit in his/her bookmark screen. A tuit can also be unbookmarked.

We have added controller, dao, models and schemas for bookmarks and messages.
